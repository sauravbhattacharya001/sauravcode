# sauravcode
Frustrated by syntax-heavy languages, I designed *sauravcode* for simplicity and clarity. It removes unnecessary punctuation and rigid conventions, focusing purely on logic. With minimal syntax, it allows ideas to flow naturally without distraction. *sauravcode* is my tool for coding as a seamless, intuitive process, free from constraints.
